This creates both an installer and portable version in the `dist` folder. No dev console will appear in built versions!

## How to Use

1. **Launch the app** using `npm start` (or run the built executable)

2. **Find your game** - Two options:

   **Option A: Search by name (Easiest!)**
   - Type your game's name in the search box
   - Wait for results to appear (autocomplete)
   - Click your game from the dropdown
   - App ID is filled automatically!

   **Option B: Manual App ID entry**
   - Find your game on Steam's store page
   - Look at the URL: `store.steampowered.com/app/APPID/GameName`
   - Copy the numeric App ID and paste it
   - Example: Paint the Town Red = `337320`

3. **Click "Install GlobalFix"**

5. **Wait for completion** - The app will:
   - Locate your game installation
   - Find the game's executable
   - Download GlobalFix.zip
   - Extract it to the game folder
   - Configure unsteam.ini
   - Update Steam launch options

6. **Restart Steam** to apply the changes

7. **Launch your game** from Steam as usual

## What the App Does

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Steam Detection:** Finds your Steam installation path
2. **Library Discovery:** Reads all Steam library folders from `libraryfolders.vdf`
3. **Game Location:** Finds the game by reading `appmanifest_[AppID].acf`
4. **Executable Detection:** Locates the main game executable
5. **Download:** Downloads GlobalFix.zip from this repository
6. **Extraction:** Extracts all files to the game directory
7. **Configuration:** Modifies `unsteam.ini`:
   ```ini
   exe_file=YourGameExecutable.exe
   real_app_id=YourAppID
   ```
8. **Launch Options:** Updates Steam config with:
   ```
   "C:\Path\To\Game\unsteam_loader64" %command%
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Steam installation not found"
- Ensure Steam is installed in a standard location
- Check if Steam is installed at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam` or `C:\Program Files\Steam`

### "Game with AppID not found"
- Verify the App ID is correct
- Ensure the game is installed through Steam
- Try validating game files in Steam

### "Could not find game executable"
- The game may have an unusual structure
- Check if the game has multiple executables
- You may need to manually verify the installation

### "Launch options could not be updated"
- Make sure Steam is closed when running the installer
- Check that you have write permissions to Steam's config files
- You can manually add the launch options in Steam:
  Right-click game → Properties → Launch Options:
  ```
  "C:\Full\Path\To\Game\unsteam_loader64" %command%
  ```
